# textractor

textractor is a ruby library that provides a simple wrapper around CLI tools for extracting text from PDF and Word documents.

## Setup

    gem install textractor

In order to use textractor you have to install a few command line tools.

### OS X

#### Homebrew

    brew install xpdf links wv

#### MacPorts

    port install wv xpdf links

I recommend using also passing +no_x11 to the install command, but this may not work on all systems due to dependency issues.

    port install wv xpdf links +no_x11

### Ubuntu 8.04

    apt-get install wv xpdf-utils links

### Ubuntu 12.04

    apt-get install wv xpdf-utils links unzip

### Perl (*sigh*)

Yes, this is slightly ridiculous, but a working perl installation is required in order to extract text from a docx file.

### mimetype-fu (optional)

    gem install mimetype-fu

If you plan on using more than the default extractors it is a good idea to install mimetype-fu.  This will allow much more robust content type detection.

## Usage

### Basics

Due to textractor's reliance on command line tools all the methods in textractor work on paths not File objects.

    Textractor.text_from_path(path_to_document) # => "Ruby on rails developer"

Textractor will attempt to guess what type of document you're trying to extract text from.  However, if you know the content type of your document, you can provide it and Textractor won't guess.

    Textractor.text_from_path(path_to_document, :content_type => "application/doc")

### Custom Extractors

It's possible to define additional extractors for additional content types.  An extractor only has to respond to a single method `text_from_path`.

    class HTMLExtractor < Textractor::Extractors::TextExtractor

      def text_from_path(path)
        document = Nokogiri::HTML(super)
        document.text
      end

    end

    Textractor.register_content_type("text/html", HTMLExtractor)

It is also possible to use a block as a simple content type extractor:

    Textractor.register_content_type("text/html") do |path|
      data = File.read(path)
      document = Nokogiri::HTML(data)
      document.text
    end

You can also remove a content type extractor:

    Textractor.remove_content_type("text/html")

Or clear out all known extractors:

    Textractor.clear_registry

## TODO

* Remove vendored docx2txt perl script
* Replace as much as possible with pure ruby

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
